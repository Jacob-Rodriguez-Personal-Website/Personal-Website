    <h3 class="Hobby1"> Formula 1 </h3> <!-- Still need to add images and a persistent header-->
    <p> Forumla 1 is not only one of my favorite sports to watch it also has some great lessions to learn about life within the sport. It inspires me to keep pushing the limits of my abilites and to keep pushing forward no matter what.</p>

    <h3 class="hobby2"> Gaming</h3>
    <P> Gaming is also one of my favorite things to do, the game doesn't matter. I think what matters more is if I am having fun either alone or with my best friends. I think gaming has helped me become a more open person, because in most games you have to work together as a team to complete and objective. Some of my favortite games at the moment are the Resident Evil 4 remake that jsut came out, Bioshock, Borderlands 2, and Destiny. </P>

    <h3 class="hobby3"> Wrestling</h3>
    <p> Wrestling is one of my other favorite hobbies. I love wrestling because it's entertaining, because of the storylines, the characters, the moves. Wrestling is special to me because it has been a part of my life for as long as I remember.</p>
